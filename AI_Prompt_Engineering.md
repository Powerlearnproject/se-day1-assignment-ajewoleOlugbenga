**Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering:**

AI (Artificial Intelligence) creates systems that perform tasks requiring human intelligence. Prompt engineering involves crafting precise instructions to get accurate outputs from AI models. A vague prompt like "Tell me about sandwiches" can be improved to "Give me a step-by-step recipe for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich," making it more effective by being clear and specific.
